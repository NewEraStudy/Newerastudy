## AI Plan Features

### 🧠 Cognitive Load Balancing
The AI ensures you don't:
- Schedule all hard subjects together
- Study the same type of material consecutively
- Overload any single day

**Example:**
```
❌ Bad: Math → Physics → Chemistry (all STEM)
✅ Good: Math → English → Physics (varied)
```

### ⏰ Circadian Rhythm Optimization
Study timing based on science:

**Morning (High alertness):**
- Complex problem-solving (Math, Physics)
- New concept learning
- Critical thinking tasks

**Afternoon (Post-lunch dip):**
- Review sessions
- Lighter subjects
- Creative work

**Evening (Consolidation):**
- Review today's material
- Flashcard practice
- Planning tomorrow

### 🔄 Spaced Repetition Integration
The AI builds in review sessions:
- Review today's material: Same evening
- Review again: 1 day later
- Review again: 3 days later
- Review again: 1 week later

### 📈 Progressive Overload
Plans increase in intensity:
- Week 1: Build foundation
- Week 2-3: Increase difficulty
- Week 4: Peak performance
- Week 5: Review & consolidate

## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO:
1. **Be Honest** about available time
2. **Update regularly** as schedule changes
3. **Track progress** in Analytics
4. **Adjust** if plan feels too hard/easy
5. **Use Pomodoro** for time blocking
6. **Follow peak times** - they matter!
7. **Take breaks** as recommended

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Overschedule** - leave buffer time
2. **Ignore energy levels** - work with your body
3. **Skip breaks** - they improve retention
4. **Multitask** during study blocks
5. **Study right before bed** - affects sleep
6. **Cram everything** in one day

## Advanced Features

### Re-Generate Plans
Generate new plans:
- **Weekly** - for fresh perspective
- **After exams** - new priorities
- **When struggling** - adjust difficulty
- **New semester** - different subjects

### Compare Plans
Track which approaches work best:
1. Generate plan A (aggressive)
2. Try for 1 week
3. Generate plan B (moderate)
4. Compare results in Analytics

### Customize AI Output
Mention in "Challenges":
```
"I need more breaks between sessions"
"Focus on visual learning techniques"
"Include group study recommendations"
"Add test-taking strategies"
"Suggest memory techniques for dates/facts"
```

## Understanding Your Analytics Impact

The AI uses your data intelligently:

### High Completion Rate (>80%)
→ AI suggests: More challenging material, longer sessions

### Low Completion Rate (<50%)
→ AI suggests: Shorter sessions, easier material first, more breaks

### Long Study Streak (7+ days)
→ AI suggests: Maintain current approach, add variety

### No Streak / Just Starting
→ AI suggests: Build habit first, start small, increase gradually

### Many Pomodoro Sessions
→ AI suggests: You're doing great! Optimize timing and subjects

### Few Sessions
→ AI suggests: Start with 1-2 subjects, build from there

## Troubleshooting

### "Plan feels too aggressive"
**Solution:**
1. Reduce "Hours per day"
2. Select "Short sessions"
3. Mention in challenges: "Need a gentle, realistic plan"
4. Re-generate
